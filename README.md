# Capstone project: SweetSpot - Weather Analysis App

## Overview

This application wil allow users to explore various locations in the USA for desired/undesired weather factors based on user’s input of specific weather factors

Target Audience:
Anyone interested in exploring weather patterns in the location where they live or the location they consider moving to.

Elevator pitch:
This app will allow users to explore weather patterns in their current or future location. Such weather information can be used to track migraine symptoms for example or make decisions about where to move/live. 

The app will consist of the following webpages:

Main: enter location to search, select factors to track, duration of time, and display results
About: explain the methodology and measurements of weather factors
Results: shows results of the query

User flow:
User enters their location, selects weather criteria, enters number of days to go back, and sees the  results for the selected criteria. The results are displayed in two tables: one shows raw data, and the second table shows fluctuations (exact statistical configuration of fluctuations remains to be determined based on what data will be available for analysis, which depends on specific API’s used)

Wireframes:
See PDF

Color Palette:
“Natural” and moderate colors that can be seen on a farm in the northern hemisphere: white, black, green, brown, red, yellow. So, no lush tropical colors or synthetic-looking hues.

List Applications Researched: (links to websites / applications) accuweather.com, weather.com
List what you like about each site: big coverage and lots of details
List what you do not like about each site: it does not give information about barometric pressure, precipitation and other changes over time such as day to day or intra-day. You cannot gather select only certain criteria but must look for them and write them down on paper manually to create your own table

SWOT analysis:

Strengths: Meets a certain demand for those who want to know about specific weather factors; fills a gap
Weaknesses: Relies on existing API’s where data can be aggregated using unreliable or inconsistent methods
Opportunities: This app can be made more comprehensive and versatile to meet the needs of migraine suffers for instance
Threats: Accuracy and reliability depends on external API’s with little control over data collection methods. As a result, any flaws in data collection methods will affect the accuracy of the app.
